Economics, over the years, has become more and more abstract and divorced from events in the real world. Economists, by and large, do not study the workings of the actual economic system.

Dear Lord... So far today I am doing all right. I have not gossiped, lost my temper, been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish, or over-indulgent. However, I am going to get out of bed in a few minutes, and I will need a lot more help after that. Amen.

I don't know of a single foreign product that enters this country untaxed, except the answer to prayer. <br />	-- Mark Twain
If animals could speak, the dog would be a blundering outspoken fellow; but the cat would have the rare grace of never saying a word too much. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I find that principles have no real force except when one is well fed. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I find that the further I go back, the better things, whether they happened or not. <br />	-- Mark Twain
If man had created man, he would be ashamed of his performance. <br />	-- Mark Twain
If we were supposed to talk more than we listen, then we would have two mouths and only one ear. <br />	-- Mark Twain
If you have nothing to say, say nothing. <br />	-- Mark Twain
If you invent two or three people and turn them loose in your manuscript, something is bound to happen to them -- you can't help it; and then it will take you the rest of the book to get them out of the natural consequences of that occurrence, and so first thing you know, there's your book all finished up and never cost you an idea. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Ignorant people think it is the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain't so; it is the sickening grammar that they use. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I have found out that there ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I have never taken any exercise except sleeping and resting. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I have not a particle of confidence in a man who has no redeeming vices. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I'm glad I did it, partly because it was worth it, but mostly because I shall never have to do it again. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I must have a prodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a week sometimes to make it up. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Indecency, vulgarity, obscenity -- these are strictly confined to man; he invented them. Among the higher animals there is no trace of them. They hide nothing; they are not ashamed. Man, with his soiled mind, covers himself... Man is the Animal that Blushes. He is the only one that does it -- or has occasion to. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I never could tell a lie that anybody would doubt, nor a truth that anybody would believe. <br />	-- Mark Twain
In the real world, the right thing never happens in the right place and the right time. It is the job of journalists and historians to make it appear that it has. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I respect a man who knows how to spell a word more than one way. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I thoroughly disapprove of duels. I consider them unwise and I know they are dangerous. Also, sinful. If a man should challenge me now I would go to that man and take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet retired spot and kill him. <br />	-- Mark Twain
It is better to deserve honors and not have them than to have them and not to deserve them. <br />	-- Mark Twain
It is discouraging to try and penetrate a mind like yours. You ought to get it out and dance on it. That would take some of the rigidity out of it. <br />	-- Mark Twain
It is not best that we should all think alike; it is differences of opinion that make horse races. <br />	-- Mark Twain
I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I didn't know. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Let us be thankful for fools. But for them the rest of us could not succeed. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Let us not be too particular: it is better to have old second hand diamonds than none at all. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Life does not consist mainly, or even largely, of facts and happenings. It consists mainly of the storm of thought that is forever flowing through one's head. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Love your enemy, it will scare the hell out of them. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Man is a Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion- several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities, War. He is the only one that gathers his brethren about him and goes forth in cold blood and calm pulse to exterminate his kind. He is the only animal that for sordid wages will march out... and help to slaughter strangers of his own species who have done him no harm and with whom he has no quarrel... And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands and works for "the universal brotherhood of man" - with his mouth. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Man is the only creature who has a nasty mind. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Methuselah lived to be 969 years old. You boys and girls will see more in the next fifty years than Methuselah saw in his whole lifetime. <br />	-- Mark Twain
My books are water; those of the great geniuses are wine -- everybody drinks water. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Never let formal education get in the way of your learning. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Nothing that grieves us can be called little: by the eternal laws of proportion a child's loss of a doll and a king's loss of a crown are events of the same size. <br />	-- Mark Twain
October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Of all God's creatures there is only one that cannot be made the slave of the lash. That one is the cat. If man could be crossed with a cat it would improve man, but it would deteriorate the cat. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Often the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict truth. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Of the delights of this world man cares most for sexual intercourse, yet he has left it out of his heaven. <br />	-- Mark Twain
One man alone can be pretty dumb sometimes, but for real bona fide stupidity there ain't nothing can beat teamwork. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Part of the secret of success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Put all your eggs in the one basket and - WATCH THAT BASKET. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Sacred cows make the best hamburger. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Substitute "damn" every time you're inclined to write "very;" your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Such is the human race, often it seems a pity that Noah... didn't miss the boat. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The fact that man knows right from wrong proves his intellectual superiority to the other creatures; but the fact that he can do wrong proves his moral inferiority to any creatures that cannot. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The holy passion of friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, if not asked to lend money. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling; the comic and the witty upon the matter. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty and a premium upon ignorance, stupidity and perjury. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The pause - that impressive silence, that eloquent silence, that geometrically progressive silence, which often achieves a desired effect where no combination of words, howsoever felicitous, could accomplish it. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The public is the only critic whose opinion is worth anything at all. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The radical of one century is the conservative of the next. The radical invents the views. When he has worn them out, the conservative adopts them. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one -- keep from telling their happiness to the unhappy. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There are some books that refuse to be written. They stand their ground year after year and will not be persuaded. It isn't because the book is not there and worth being written -- it is only because the right form of the story does not present itself. There is only one right form for a story and if you fail to find that form the story will not tell itself. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There are too many stars in some places and not enough in others. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There are two times in a man's life when he should not speculate: when he can't afford it, and when he can. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There comes a time in every rightly constructed boy's life that he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There's always something about your success that displeases even your best friends. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There is no sadder sight than a young pessimist, except an old optimist. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There is nothing training cannot do. Nothing is above its reach. It can turn bad morals to good; it can destroy bad principles and recreate good ones; it can lift men to angelship. <br />	-- Mark Twain
There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The secret of success is to make your vocation your vacation. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one. <br />	-- Mark Twain
The trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that ain't so. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Thunder is good, thunder is impressive, but it is lightning that does the work. <br />	-- Mark Twain
They spell it "da Vinci" and pronounce it "da Vinchy". Foreigners always spell better than they pronounce. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Time cools, time clarifies; no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer. <br />	-- Mark Twain
We do not deal in facts when we are contemplating ourselves. <br />	-- Mark Twain
We had the stars up there," said Huck, "And we use to lie on our backs and look up at them and discuss 'bout whether they was made or just happened. Jim he allowed that the stars was made, but I allowed they just happened. Jim said the Moon could'a laid them; Well, that looked kind of reasonable so I didn't say nothing against it. I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. <br />	-- Mark Twain
We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. <br />	-- Mark Twain
We have a criminal jury system which is superior to any in the world; and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty of finding twelve men every day who don't know anything and can't read. <br />	-- Mark Twain
We have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has, because we know how it is made. We have lost as much as we gained by prying into that matter. <br />	-- Mark Twain
We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one either. <br />	-- Mark Twain
What is the most rigorous law of our being?  Growth. No smallest atom of our moral, mental, or physical structure can stand still a year. It grows - it must grow; nothing can prevent it. <br />	-- Mark Twain
When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are decaying now and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the things that never happened. It is sad to go to pieces like this but we all have to do it. <br />	-- Mark Twain
When one has tasted watermelon he knows what the angels eat. <br />	-- Mark Twain
When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained. <br />	-- Mark Twain
When you ascend the hill of prosperity, may you not meet a friend. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to reform. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Why shouldn't truth be stranger than fiction?  Fiction after all, has to make sense. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Work and play are words used to describe the same thing under differing conditions. <br />	-- Mark Twain
Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been. <br />	-- Mark Twain
You cannot depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus. <br />	-- Mark Twain
You can't break a bad habit by throwing it out the window. You've got to walk it slowly down the stairs. <br />	-- Mark Twain
You take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear. <br />	-- Mark Twain

When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take command. Very often, that individual is crazy. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The most powerful force in the universe is gossip. <br />	-- Dave Barry
What I look forward to is continued immaturity followed by death. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The metric system did not really catch on in the States, unless you count the increasing popularity of the nine-millimeter bullet. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The leading cause of death among fashion models is falling through street grates. <br />	-- Dave Barry
First off, you need an operating system, which is the 'Godfather' program that operates behind the scenes, telling all the other programs what to do, making sure they cooperate, and if necessary leaving the heads of virtual horses in their beds. <br />	-- Dave Barry
After the little yeasts are done converting your ingredients into beer, they die horrible deaths by the millions. You shouldn't feel bad about this. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The two most common taxpayer mistakes, states the IRS booklet, are (1) 'failure to include a current address' and (2) 'failure to be a large industry that gives humongous contributions to key tax-law writing congresspersons.'  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Those of you who were fortunate enough to read last year's column no doubt recall that I advised you to cheat, on the grounds that by reducing the amount of money you gave the government, you'd be supporting the President in his program to reduce government spending. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Alaska was originally a large place located way the hell past Canada, but this proved to be highly inconvenient for mapmakers, who in 1873 voted to make it smaller and put it into a little box next to Hawaii right off the coast of Calafornia, where it is today. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The First Amendment states that members of religious groups, no matter how small and unpopular, shall have the right to hassle you in airports. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Second Amendment states that, since a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state, you can buy high-powered guns via mail order and go out into the woods with your friends and absolutely vaporize some deer. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Third Amendment states that you don't have to quarter troops inside your house. "You troops are just going to have to sleep on the patio" is a perfectly constitutional thing for you to tell them. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Fifth Amendment states that your Fifth Amendment rights cannot be violated until you are advised of them. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Sixth Amendment states that if you are accused of a crime, you have the right to a trial before a jury of people too stupid to get out of jury. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Seventh Amendment states that if you are in the Express Lane, and you have more than one item of produce of the same biological type, you may count these as one item in order to keep yourself under the ten-item limit. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The members of the Continental Congress were extremely impressed by the Decleration of Independence that Jefferson had written, at least the part that they read, and on the following day, October 8th, the nation celebrated its very first July Fourth. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Mayans were constructing a culture down in Mexico featuring a calander so advanced that it can still, to this very day, tell you where various celestial bodies such as Venus and the Moon will be at any given moment. THEY WILL BE OUT IN SPACE, states the miraculous Mayan calender. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Today's top executives eat teeny meals and run 10 miles and play tennis and work out every day. Of course, they're so busy getting fit that many don't even know where their offices are. That's why the entire U.S. economy is now manufactured in Japan. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Every morning you should take a vitamin D pill, followed by an E, until you've spelled the healthful mnemonic phrase: "A DEAD CAD BAKED A BAD CAKE, ACE."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Four Major Warning Signs of Vitamin Deficiency are: (1) Nosebleeds, (2) A sudden fondness for Wayne Newton, (3) Unusually thick coats on woolly caterpillars, and (4) Death. <br />	-- Dave Barry
White bread and refined sugar, if eaten, cause death within hours. So it's important to watch what you eat, at least until it gets inside your mouth. After that it becomes pretty disgusting. <br />	-- Dave Barry
One good place to run is in the Olympic marathon, because (a) you only have to do it once every four years, and (b) you have an armed motorcycle escort, so if people try to thrust liquids and fruits at you, which is a common problem in marathons, you can order your escort to fire a few warning rounds into their chests. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Archeologists digging in what was once ancient Sumeria recently found the remains of a primitive stone jockstrap. This goes a long way toward explaining why you see so few Sumerians around. <br />	-- Dave Barry
You can't just sit down and dash off a column that says: "The Middle East! Ha ha!  What a bunch of boogerheads!"  No, there is a lot more to it than THAT. As a respected commentator, I am expected to produce a column that is thoughtful, insightful, profound, and - above all - 800 words long. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Remember the wise words of the old Indian saying: "Before you criticize a man's collection of columns, walk a mile in his moccasins, bearing in mind that this is a good way to catch a fungus."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
All of Mister Language Person's answers are intended to be as accurate and informative as is humanly possible while still containing words such as "booger."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
I've determined that we have a worldwide exploding-thing epidemic on our hands, and until further notice we should all take the sensible precaution of avoiding things whenever possible. For example, you should never have bought this book. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Spontaneous human combustion is when people, with no apperant cause, suddenly start burning like campfire marshmellows, reaching temperatures of thousands of degrees andbeing completely reduced to ashes. This is often fatal. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The responsibility for getting rid of the carcass of the eight-ton dead whale that washed up on Oregon's beach was placed upon the Oregon State Highway Division, apparently on the theory that highways and whales are very similar in the sense of being large objects. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Professor Donald Johnson has been studying cow flatulence for 20 years, and has determined that the average cow emits 200 to 400 quarts of methane PER DAY, resulting in a total annual world cow methane output of 50 million metric TONS. (Campers: This is yet another argument for NEVER allowing a cow inside your sleeping bag.)  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Clearly what is called for is a federal task force, ideally headed by Dan Quayle, who seems to have a lot of spare time, assuming that he is not called upon to suddenly, without warning, become the president of the United States. (Published in DAVE BARRY TALKS BACK, 1991)  <br />	-- Dave Barry
All the people who have led moral lives will go straight to heaven, whereas you and your friends are going to suffer through seven years of war, plagues, famines, and sitting in a small room while a man named "Nate" explains the advantages of time-sharing. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The article quotes a wildlife official as saying that great horned owls "regularly" attack people. "They have very powerful feet," the official says, leading us to believe that it is just a matter of time before these creatures are employed by automobile dealerships ("No thanks really, I was just look... HEY!  Let GO!!"). <br />	-- Dave Barry
18th Century Tax Forms: "To determineth the amounteth that thou canst claimeth for depreciation to thine cow, deducteth the amount showneth on Line XVLIICX-A of Schedule XIV, from the amount showneth on Line CVXILIIVMM of Schedule XVVII... No, waiteth, we meaneth Line XCII of Schedule CXVIILMM... No holdeth it, we meaneth..."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
The scientists at the World Center for Birds of Prey are trying to breed falcons, sometimes via artificial insemination, which means they (the scientists) have to get hold of some falcon semen, which you cannot simply pick up in your local supermarket. (Well, OK, you CAN, but it's not fresh.)  <br />	-- Dave Barry
A Health Reminder from the Bureau of Medical Alarm: Don't smoke or drink. Or eat. Or go outside. Or breathe. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The metric conversion was clearly a good idea, and when the government started putting up metric highway signs (SPEED LIMIT 173 CENTIPDES) Americans warmly responded by shooting them down. Thus, the metric system did not really catch on in the States, unless you count the increasing popularity of the nine-millimeter bullet. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Anybody who has ever seen a photograph showing the kind of damage that a trout falling at such a high speed can inflict on the human skull knows that such photographs are very valuable. I paid $20 for mine. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Dave's Safety Precautions: (1) Never keep three-year-old children around the house. (2) If you do, never sleep. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Disney World is a place where your dreams really do come true, if you dream about having people wearing enormous cartoon-animal heads come around to your restaurant table and act whimsical and refuse to go away until you laugh with delight. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I think the people wearing enormous cartoon-animal heads at Disney World are part of a corporate discipline program for Disney executives: "Johnson, your department is over budget again. You know what that means." "No! Please!"  "Yes!  INTO THE GOOFY SUIT!"  <br />	-- Dave Barry
I like Disney World. The rest rooms are clean enough for neurosurgery, and the employees say things like "Howdy, folks!" and actually seem to mean it. You wonder: Where do they get these people?  My guess: 1952. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Tragically, my wife and I both happen to be domestically impaired. If we were birds, our nest would consist of a single twig with the eggs attached via Scotch tape. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Nintendo enables the child to develop a sense of self-worth by mastering a complex, demanding task that makes his father look like a total goober. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The typical Nintendo game involves controlling a little man who runs around on the screen trying to stay alive while numerous powerful and inexplicably hostile forces try to kill him; in other words, it's exactly like real life. <br />	-- Dave Barry
When I play Nintendo, the little man on the screen becomes highly suicidal. If he can't locate a hostile force to get killed by, he will deliberately swallow the contents of a little elctronic Valium bottle. So all my games end instantly, whereas my son can keep the little man alive through several presidential administrations. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The trick to remember while backing a boat into a carport is, if you turn your car wheels to the right ("starboard"), the boat trailer will actually go to the LEFT ("forecastle"), until your wife ("Beth") announces that you have run over a sprinkler head ("$12.95"). <br />	-- Dave Barry
Finally, when I was fully confident that, if necessary, I could take the boat out myslef and get everyone killed, we returned home to spend a carefree evening washing our hull. You have to do this because - get ready for a fascinating nautical fact - seawater is very bad for boats. <br />	-- Dave Barry
We wanted to have a relaxing family vacation, so we got together with two other families and rented a sailboat in the Virgin Islands. There is nothing as relaxing as being out on the open sea,listening to the waves and the wind and the sails and voices downstairs yelling "HOW DO YOU FLUSH THESE TOILETS?"  <br />	-- Dave Barry
We hired a local captain for the first afternoon of our cruise to demonstrate the finer points of seamanship. He was on our boat for a total of three hours, during which he demonstrated that he could drink six of our beers and two large direct-from-the-bottle swigs of our rum and still not fall headfirst into the Caribbean. <br />	-- Dave Barry
It's a basic rule of seamanship that everybody's clothes have to be wet all the time. If there's no wind to make the ship lean over, thus allowing water to splash in and get all the clothes wet, you are required by maritime law to throw your clothes overboard a couple of times a day. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The key to a successful Summer Vacation Adventure is preperation. For example, if you're planning a trip to Europe to visit historic sites such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame Cathedral, you should prepare RIGHT NOW by setting fire to your airline tickets. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Until I became a parent, I thought children just naturally knew how to catch a ball, that catching was an instinctive biological reflex that all children are born with, like knowing how to operate the remote control or getting high fevers in distant airports. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I was genuinely surprised by the hostile reaction to my column about England, and all I can say to those concerned is: I humbly apoligize for offending you, and I promise that I will never, ever again, even in jest, say anything remotely insulting about England, and I especially will not make note of the obvious defects in the royal gene pool. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Recently my family and I spent a week in London, which is a popular foreign place to visit because they have learned to speak some English over there. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The British have a lot of trouble with pronunciation, because they can't move their jaw muscles, because of malnutrition caused by wisely refusing to eat English food, much of which was designed and manufactured in medieval times during the reign of King Walter the Mildly Disturbed. <br />	-- Dave Barry
English history consists largely of royal people getting their heads chopped off, which is why members of the royal family now wear protective steel neck inserts, which is why they walk the way they do. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In America, people drive on the RIGHT side of the street, whereas in London, they drive on BOTH sides of the street, using hard-to-see cars about the size of toaster ovens. The best way to handle this, as a tourist, is to remain on one side of the street for your entire visit, and see the other side on another trip. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Hawaiian Islands were discovered by hardy Polynesian sailors, who crossed thousands of miles of open ocean in primitive canoes, braving violent storm-tossed seas for months at a time. My family and I arrived by modern commercial aviation, which was infinitely worse. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Here at the Institute of Scary foods we are highly suspicious of olives, which, in our opinion, are the eyeballs of giant frogs. We believe that if you stood outside an olive factory, you'd hear the unmistakable tragic sound (RIBBETT-THUMP; RIBBETT-THUMP) of terrified sightless frogs leaping into things. <br />	-- Dave Barry
This fall, we'll be seeing a new, redesigned $20 bill. This is part of an anti-counterfeiting program to redesign all of our old currency, which has become too easy to duplicate with modern color photocopiers - a fact that was made all too clear when the Xerox Corp., in its 1997 annual report, reported profits of "$850 trillion, mostly in 50s."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
To thwart would-be photocopiers, instead of saying "TWENTY DOLLARS," the new, redesigned $20 bills say "FIFTEEN DOLLARS."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
I turned 50, which is really not so old. A lot of very famous people accomplished great things after 50. For example, it was during the post-50 phase of his life that the brilliant physicist Albert Einstein produced the vast majority of his drool. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I decided I'd better go in for my annual physical examination, which is something I do approximately every seven to nine years. <br />	-- Dave Barry
>From the Hippocratic Oath: "And I swear by my Lexus that if a person comes into my office for any reason, whether it be for a physical examination or simply to deliver the mail, I will find something medically wrong with that person."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Everybody should have a pet. And I'm not saying this just because the American Pet Council gave me a helicopter. I'm also saying it because my family has always owned pets, and without them, our lives would not be nearly so rich in - call me sentimental, but this is how I feel - dirt. <br />	-- Dave Barry
A Labrador retriever is a large enthusiastic bulletproof species of dog made entirely of synthetic materials. This is the kind of dog that, if it takes an interest in your personal regions (which of course it does) you cannot fend it off with a blowtorch. <br />	-- Dave Barry
For sheer hostility in a pet, you can't beat a parrot. I base this statement on a parrot I knew named Charles who belonged to a couple named Ed and ginny. Charles had an IQ of 260 and figured out early in life that if he talked to people, they'd get close enough so he could bite them. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I got hundreds of responses to my "Eat Bugs For Money" column, including dozens of people who were willing to eat bugs for free. Bear in mind that, under our system of government, these people can vote. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys are biologically capable of keeping track of a huge number of TV programs simultaneously by changing the channel the instant something boring happens, such as dialouge. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Women, because of a tragic genetic flaw, feel compelled to watch only ONE PROGRAM AT A TIME, the way people did back in the Middle Ages, before the invention of the remote control. <br />	-- Dave Barry
There was a survey in which researchers asked tourists how come they didn't want to come back to New York City, and the tourists said it was because there was so much mean-spiritedness. So the researchers spat on them. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Everybody in New York, including police horses, dresses fashionably, and whenevr I'm there, even in my sharpest funeral-quality suit with no visible ketchup stains, I feel as though I'm wearing a Hefty trash bag. And it's LAST YEAR'S Hefty trash bag. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The United Nations reception area was filled with representatives of nations large and small, rich and poor, from all over the world; and although I sometimes tend to be cynical, I could not help but be deeply moved, as a journalist and a human being, by the fact that some of these people had haircuts EVEN WORSE THAN MINE. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I am forced to admit that I would rather undergo a vasectomy via Weed Whacker than attend an opera. The one time I did sit through one, it lasted approximately as long as fourth grase and featured large men singing for 45 minutes in a foreign language merely to observe that the sun had risen. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Holiday Season is here again, and there's "something special" in the air. It's the aroma being given off by our mailperson, who expired in our driveway several days ago while attempting to deliver 300 pounds of Holiday Greeting cards. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Ten Plagues of Egypt are: blood, darkness, blight, slaying of the first born, wild beasts, lice, boils, locusts, hail and -- you guessed it -- Leonardo DiCaprio. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The First Rule of Car Buying is one that I learned long ago from my father, namely: Never buy any car that my father would buy. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Modern cars employ all kinds of technologically advanced concepts such as measuring the engine in "liters."  Let's say you buy a car with a "5.7 liter engine": This means that when it breaks, you should not ask your mechanic how much it's going to cost until you've consumed 5.7 liters of a manufacturer-approved wine. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Pennies were invented during the Great Depression, a grim era that was filmed entirely in black and white. The nation needed a very small unit of money, because back then - ask anybody who lived through it - the average salary was only four cents per year, and houses cost a dime, and a dollar would buy you a working railroad. <br />	-- Dave Barry
It is at times like this that we should remember the words of President John F. Kennedy, who, in his stirring inaugural address, said: "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask whether your country has been inhaling paint-thinner fumes."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
You readers really came through in our Defecit Reduction Contest, proving once againthat when the American people decide to "get involved" in a problem, it is best not to let them have any sharp implements. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In your suggestions for our Defecit Reduction Contest, by reading between the lines, I detected a certain amount of hostility in these entries, especially the ones proposing a nuclear strike on the U.S. Capitol. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I am sick and tired of our so-called representatives in Washington being influenced by powerful special-interest groups on crucial federal issues. As you have no doubt gathered, I am referring to the current effort to name an Official National Insect. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Today's Tip for Fiction Writers: To make your writing more vivid, insert a literary device. WEAK: "Detective Jake Turmoil slowly opened the door to the killer's room."  STRONG: "Detective Jake Turmoil slowly opened the door to the killer's room and a metaphor sliced off his head."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
IRS HUMOR EXAMPLE: "A lawyer, a doctor, and a priest were marooned on a desert island. So we consificated their homes."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
English spelling is unusual because our language is a rich verbal tapestry woven together from the tounges of the Greeks, the Latins, the Angles, the Klaxons, the Celtics, the 76ers, and many other ancient peoples, all of whom had severe drinking problems. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The main punctuation marks are the period, the coma, the colonel, the semicolonel, the probation mark, the catastrophe, the eclipse, the Happy Face, and the box where the person checks "yes" to receive more information. <br />	-- Dave Barry
There is definitely too much anger in the world today. Pick up almost any newspaper, and the odds are you'll get ink smeared all over your hands. We use a special kind of easy-smear ink, because we know how much it irritates you. <br />	-- Dave Barry
As you know if you ever studied the famous Greek philosopher Aristotle, he was easily the most boring human being who ever lived. <br />	-- Dave Barry
We can find evidence of anger in the animal kingdom. The great white shark, for example, periodically gets furious at the small seaside resort town of Amity and tries to eat all the residents, possibly in an effort to prevent another sequel. <br />	-- Dave Barry
If you were to probe inside the guy psyche, beneath that macho exterior and the endless droning about things like the 1978 World Series, you would find, deep down inside, a passionate, heartfelt interest in: the 1978 World Series. Yes. The truth is, guys don't HAVE any sensitive innermost thoughts and feelings. It's time you women knew!  <br />	-- Dave Barry
My editor, Gene, can remember the complete starting lineups for the New York Yankee teams from 1960 through 1964, and yet rountinely makes calls wherein, after he dials the phone, he forgets who he's calling, so when somebody answers, Gene has to ask (a) who it is, and (b) does this person happen to know the purpose of the call. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Today's man knows that he's supposed to be a sensitive and caring relationship partner, and he's making radical life-style changes such as sometimes remembering to remove the used tissue wads from his pockets before depositing his pants on the floor to be picked up by the Laundry Fairy. <br />	-- Dave Barry
There was respect in Robert's eyes as I strode out to face the spider. As well there should have been. Here in South Florida we have a special name for this kind of spider: We call it "a spider the size of Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School," although its technical Latin name is "Bernice."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Like many South Floridians, we have our house in a neighborhod that we are pretty sure is occupied by drug dealers, as indicated by subtle signs such as cars coming and going at all hours, bed sheets over the windows, a big sign stating, DRUGS FOR SALE HERE, etc. <br />	-- Dave Barry
If you're looking for a sport that offers both of the Surgeon General's Two Recommended Key Elements of Athletic Activity, namely (1) rental shoes and (2) beer, then you definitely want to take up bowling. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I love to bowl. I even belong to a bowling team, the Pin Worms. How good are we?  I don't wish to brag, but we happen to be ranked, in the World Bowling Association standings, under the heading "Severely Impaired."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
On planes, I always take a window seat, because I want to know if a wing falls off. The pilot would never even mention this. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys are AWARE of the rules of moral behaviour, but they have trouble keeping these rules in the forefronts of their minds at certain times, especially the present. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I realize, of course, that there are countless examples of guys being faithful to their mates until they die, usually as a result of being eaten by their mates immediately following copulation. Guys outside the spider community, however, do not have a terrific record of faithfulness. <br />	-- Dave Barry
As the ancient Greek historian Thucydides often said when he was alive, "History is a bunch of things that happened in the past."  His point was that human civilization is a journey, and only by retracing the steps of that journey can we truly come to know, as a species, where we lost our keys. <br />	-- Dave Barry
January 1, 1000, was the historic day that humanity celebrated the dawn of our current millennium. The occasion was marked by feasting, dancing, and the public beheading of a whiny, tedious group of people who would not stop insisting that, technically, the new millennium did not begin until January 1, 1001. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Feudalism was based on a "ladder-type" of organizational structure, similar to Amway. You started out on the bottom rung, in the position of serf. This was not an easy job, but if you worked hard, followed the rules, did not complain and were a "team player," after a certain period of time, you fell off the bottom rung and died. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Leif Ericson, the legendary Viking, and his hardy crew set sail from Greenland and finally, after many harrowing weeks at sea during which they almost perished, discovered a new land. It turned out to be Canada, so they went home. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1337 France, which was then under King Philip VI, was invaded by England, which was then under King Edward III, who had vowed to kill any monarch with a higher Roman numeral. This led to the Hundred Years War, which, because of delays caused by equipment problems, is still going on. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Being burned at the stake had become the punishment for just about every infraction including jousting without a permit. By the 1430s so many people had been burned at the stake that Europe ran out of stakes and had to start burning people at the lump of peat, which took forever. Eventually the fuel was exhausted, and the Dark Ages began. <br />	-- Dave Barry
And thus it was that in 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain and discovered America, which he believed was the East Indies. The reason he believed this is that prank-loving Vikings, who had discovered America 300 years earlier, had left a sign that said "WELCOME TO THE EAST INDIES!"  <br />	-- Dave Barry
By the 1500s there were ships sailing everywhere, carrying the message of European civilization to the indigenous peoples of Africa and the Americas (the message was: "Hi!  We own you!"). <br />	-- Dave Barry
Elizabeth I presided over the Elizabethan Era, which produced the immortal William Shakespeare, who wrote such timeless works as "Richard II", "Richard III", "Richard III Strikes Back" and "Hamlet Hears a Who", and who gave us a priceless legacy of famous phrases that, to this very day, are pretty much incomprehensible. <br />	-- Dave Barry
One night in 1609 an astronomer named Galileo, who had just invented a new device called the "telescope," peered through it and discovered that he could see directly into the bedroom window of a woman who lived nearly 500 feet away. As a result, many guys became interested in astronomy. Or so they told their wives. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Another important scientific advance occurred in 1614 when the logarithm was invented by Scottish mathematician John Napier. Some day, when time travel is invented, high-school students will go back and kill him. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton, after watching an apple fall off a tree, wrote his famous Principia Mathematica, which states that there is a universal force, called "gravity," inside apples. Later scientists would expand this definition to include grapefruit, but the basic concept remains unchanged to this day. <br />	-- Dave Barry
At this time France was experiencing its glory years under Louis XIV, who became known as the "Sun King" because he was more than 2 million miles in circumference. <br />	-- Dave Barry
But things were not so good for England, which in 1665 suffered through the Great Plague of London, which was followed in 1666 by the Great Fire of London, which was followed in 1667 by the first recorded attack on London by Godzilla. <br />	-- Dave Barry
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES OF THE 1700s: In England, a chemist named Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, without which many of us would not be here today. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In Egypt, soldiers discovered the Rosetta Stone (daughter of Sol and Esther Stone). This was very significant, because it enabled scholars, for the first time, to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, which turned out to be a letter from Publishers Clearing House informing the ancient Egyptians that they might already have won 200 sheep. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1765 the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which decreed that if the colonists wanted to buy stamps, they had to wait in long lines at inconveniently located postal facilities staffed by surly clerks who periodically went on murderous rampages with semiautomatic muskets. <br />	-- Dave Barry
On the fateful night of April 18, 1775, the Revolutionary War began when Paul Revere made his legendary "midnight ride," galloping all the way from Boston to Lexington while shouting the message that would resound through the annals of history: "I CAN'T STOP MY HORSE!"  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Finally, after many historic battles whose names all American schoolchildren should be forced to memorize before they are allowed to buy one more damn Pokemon card if you want our frank opinion, the British surrendered. At last, after years of oppression, all Americans were truly free! (Except for the slaves.)  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Soon the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were hard at work, and in 1788, the constitution they created underwent formal ratification, a complex legal procedure involving actual rats. <br />	-- Dave Barry
During the War of 1812 (1807-10), the British marched into Washington, D.C., and, with the help of local residents, burned the Internal Revenue Service to the ground. Tragically, it was rebuilt, and eventually the British went back to England, where many of them still reside today. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Meanwhile, over in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte had himself crowned emperor of France in recognition of the fact that he, alone among all the French, could rearrange the letters in his name to spell "Rent An Abalone Poop."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
A few years later England and China got into the Opium War, during which soldiers on both sides spent most of the time lying around staring at candles and going, "Wow!"  <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1807, an American inventor named Robert Fulton put a steam engine aboard a ship called the Clermont. Needless to say, it sank like an anvil, thus confirming the widespread scientific belief that gravity was still working. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1860, Lincoln ran for president (slogan: "He's Taller Than You") and was elected, only to see the nation rent asunder in 1861 by the Civil War, starring Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. America descended into a long, dark nightmare as brother fought against brother. As you can imagine, this drove their mother crazy. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1859, English naturalist Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking work Origin of Species, in which he theorized that life evolves, through natural selection, from lower and cruder to higher and more sophisticated levels, except in Kansas. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1869, the Suez Canal was finally completed, which meant that for the first time ships could go from wherever the Suez Canal started to wherever it ended, something that had not been possible before. <br />	-- Dave Barry
In 1877, inventor Thomas Alva Edison leaned over a device and recited "Mary Had a Little Lamb" in a loud and clear voice. Nothing happened, because the device was a pencil sharpener. Embarrassed, Edison vowed that one day he would invent an electric light so he could see what the hell he was doing. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The U.S., determined to liberate Cuba from Spanish control, dispatched the famous "Rough Riders" in the legendary charge up San Juan Hill, only to enjoy a hearty laugh at their own expense when they realized that San Juan was in Puerto Rico. Historians believe this is the first known instance of the Central Intelligence Agency in action. <br />	-- Dave Barry
But an even more important thing happened in on Dec. 17, 1903, in Kitty Hawk, N.C.: two bicycle mechanics named Wilbur and Orville Wright Brothers, who as boys had dreamed of building a flying machine so they could drop bombs on the kids who laughed at them for being named "Wilbur" and "Orville," successfully tested the first airplane. <br />	-- Dave Barry
It was also an Age of Exploration. In 1909, Robert E. Peary reported that he had reached the North Pole; in 1911, Roald Amundsen reported that he had reached the South Pole; and in 1913 Walter M. Fleemotz of Decatur, Ga., reported that he had discovered the West Pole in his basement. <br />	-- Dave Barry
On a more upbeat note, the Russians, after centuries of oppression, finally got rid of the Czar System of government and switched to the Communist Dictator System, epitomized by Joseph Stalin, who came to power with the popular slogan "He Wants To Kill Pretty Much Everybody."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote (for men). <br />	-- Dave Barry
In the arena of scientific progress, a German-born physicist named Albert Einstein was thinking up things that were so amazing they made his hair stick out. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The nation was plunged into the Great Depression, which resulted in joblessness, homelessness, poverty, hunger and literally millions of Shirley Temple movies, traces of which can still be seen today. <br />	-- Dave Barry
There was also hope in the Middle East, where the state of Israel was born in a happy celebration highlighted by festive artillery fire that is still going on in some areas. <br />	-- Dave Barry
And so, this New Year's Eve, when the clock strikes 12, raise a glass to toast the millions of our ancestors who went before us, paving the way for the safe and secure civilization that we enjoy today. Then, when the clock strikes 13 and the lights go out, start your generator and load your gun. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Dave on Y2K: At exactly midnight on Dec. 31, all the computers in the world, and an estimated 80 percent of the Etch-a-Sketches, will malfunction. In one way, this is good: Your Permanent Record from school will be erased forever, which means future generations will never find out that you once mooned a Thanksgiving assembly. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Dave on Y2K: Lights will go out; phones will stop working; juke boxes will refuse to play anything except ``Copacabana''; VCR machines will suddenly start displaying the correct time; and airline computers will charge people who are on the same flight THE EXACT SAME FARE. Within hours, civilization will collapse. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Unfortunately for Bill Gates, who built himself a house the size of the Houston Astrodome to store canned food in, the Y2K problem is also going to cause all the can openers in the world, both electric and manual, to become inoperable. But don't worry about Bill Gates: He employs many skilled, highly intelligent engineers. So he can eat them. <br />	-- Dave Barry
You must find a way, right now, to feed your family when Y2K strikes. You will NOT be able to grow crops, because photosynthesis will no longer work (many areas will also be without gravity). <br />	-- Dave Barry
Star Wars has become an important and cherished part of our shared cultural heritage, like Starbucks and Pez. And soon another chapter will be added to the Star Wars legend with the release of the long-awaited new installment in the series, entitled Episode One: The Empire Gets a Building Permit. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Dave on the characters of the original Star Wars trilogy: Along the way, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) meets many memorable characters, including Han Solo (Indiana Jones), Chewbacca (Sonny Bono), Princess Leia (Prince) and two quirky, lovable robots, C-3PO (Tony Danza) and R2-D2 (F7-Z9). <br />	-- Dave Barry
When a woman shops for clothes, her primary objective is NOT to find clothes that fit her particular body. Her primary objective is to purchase clothes that are the size she wore when she was 19 years old. This will be some arbitrary number such as "8" or "10." Don't ask me "8" or "10" of what; that question has baffled scientists for centuries. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The point, young people, is that there is a right way and a wrong way to prepare for your SATs, and unless you are even stupider than you look, you want to do it the right way. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The term "SAT" is a set of initials, or "antonym," standing for "Scholastic Attitude Treaty Organization."  This is a series of tests that predict your ability to perform in the college environment by measuring the degree to which you possess knowledge that nobody would ever in a million years actually need. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The SAT was developed by the prestigious Educational Testing Service, which is located in Princeton, N.J., home of Harvard University. The original idea behind the SATs, as stated in the E.T.S.'s Official Historical Statement of Goals and Purposes, was "to sell a huge quantity of No. 2 pencils that we ordered by mistake."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Experts suggest that if you don't know the answer on an SAT, you start by "weeding out" the answers that are obviously false. Some of the telltale signs to look for are: * The answer contains swear words. * The answer contains the phrase "according to a White House spokesperson."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Microsoft's No. 1 product is Windows, which now comes automatically installed on every computer in the world and many kitchen appliances. Technically, Windows is an "operating system," which means that it supplies your computer with the basic commands that it needs to suddenly, with no warning whatsoever, stop operating. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I also want Janet Reno to appoint somebody -- I'm thinking Kenneth Starr -- to look into the very real possibility that Windows is cheating at solitaire. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Members of the Class of 1997, as I stand before you to deliver your commencement address, I am reminded of a humorous story. Unfortunately, I can't tell it, because it's dirty. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Young people, you'll find that the things you learned in school will be vitally important to your success, provided that you are a contestant on Jeopardy. Otherwise they're useless. <br />	-- Dave Barry
And what is the Scientific Community doing about these problems, young people?  THEY'RE CLONING SHEEP. Great!  Just what we need!  Sheep that look MORE ALIKE than they already do!  Thanks a lot, Scientific Community!  <br />	-- Dave Barry
We live in troubled and uncertain times, but I am feeling good -- about myself; about my homeland; about all the nations of the earth; and, yes, about future of humanity. And I will tell you why: I am on painkillers. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I believe that we parents must encourage our children to become educated, so they can get into a good college that we cannot afford. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Last year, in history class, my son Rob studied The Sixties. That's right: The Sixties are now considered a historical period, just like the Roman Empire, except that as far as modern kids are concerned, The Sixties featured stupider haircuts. <br />	-- Dave Barry
My point is that I have never been a huge fan of Beowulf, or epic poems in general. "Epic," in my opinion, is a code word that English teachers use for "boring," the same way they use "satirical" when they mean "you will not laugh once."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys do not get enough credit for being domestic. This is because the people who give OUT the credits for being domestic are -- not to generalize or anything -- women. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys are sometimes accused of not having a domestic "flair" just because they tend to accessorize a room with used pizza boxes. But there are examples of guys coming up with decorative "touches" that Martha Stewart would never conceive of even with the aid of world-class narcotics. <br />	-- Dave Barry
So let's not say that guys are not domestic, OK?  When we see a guy who makes drapes by nailing trash bags over his windows, let's remember that he might have a legitimate domestic reason, such as that he ran out of duct tape. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Many people, responding to a column I wrote on the SAT tests, angrily objected to my statement that Princeton, N.J., is the home of Harvard University. Whoops!  Princeton is of course the home of Yale University. Harvard University, according to the directory of the American Society of Colleges and Universities, is a type of weevil. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Second, I received a letter from a woman who chastised me for stating, in a column about the Napa Valley, that "pinot noir" is French for "a type of wine."  This is totally incorrect: "pinot noir" is actually French for "not a type of wine."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
But the point is that I am very sorry about these pesky errors that keep creeping into my column, and I am grateful to the many readers who, week after week, write angry letters correcting me. This is in no way whatsoever related to the topic of this week's column; namely: Is the public stupid?  <br />	-- Dave Barry
In closing, let me repeat that I am not saying that YOU are stupid. You, personally, are highly intelligent. How do I know this?  Because I'm psychic!  I also know that your name . . . wait a minute . . . it's coming to me . . . your name contains at least one vowel. Am I right? I knew it!  Pretty impressive, huh?  Send me some money. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Magnetism is one of the Six Fundamental Forces of the Universe, with the other five being Gravity, Duct Tape, Whining, Remote Control and The Force That Pulls Dogs Toward The Groins Of Strangers. <br />	-- Dave Barry
How are you, the Class of 1999, going to respond when the Clock-Radio of Challenge emits the Irritating Buzz of Opportunity?  Are you going to roll over and hit the Snooze Button of Complacency?  Or are you going to wake up and, after performing the Bodily Functions of Preparedness, boldly grasp the Toothbrush of Tomorrow?  <br />	-- Dave Barry
I hope you are ready to take over, Class of '99, because my generation is getting old and tired. And we have good reason to be tired: We won World War II. No, wait, that was our parents. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Thanks to the Internet, all you have to do is type in the words "population of Rhode Island" into your computer, and a moment later the number appears on your computer screen: 467,298. This is not the population of Rhode Island, of course: This is the number of Web sites that contain the words "population," "Rhode," "Island" or "of."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
Men tend to attach great significance to Manhood. This results in certain characteristically masculine, by which I mean stupid, behavioral patterns that can produce unfortunate results such as violent crime, war, spitting and ice hockey. These things have given males a bad name (specifically, "asshole"). <br />	-- Dave Barry
I realize that I'm making gender-based generalizations here, but my feeling is that if God did not want us to make gender-based generalizations, She would not have given us genders. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I'm not saying guys are scum. I'm saying that many guys who consider themselves to be committed to their marriages will stray if they are confronted with overwhelming temptation, defined as "virtually any temptation."  Okay, so maybe I AM saying guys are scum. But they're not MEAN-SPIRITED scum. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Sitting around for no reason in the guise of being engaged in productive work was the first real guy contribution to human civilization, forming the underlying basis for many modern institutions and activities such as fishing, sales confrences, highway repair, the federal government, and "Customer Service."  <br />	-- Dave Barry
The most significant achievement of ancient Egyptian guys occurred at the funeral of the great Pharaoh Amentooten III, when some guys invented the famous "Substitute Mummy Filled with Live Weasels" prank. This lead to the collapse of the Egyptian empire, but everybody involved agreed it was worth it. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Middle Ages saw the breakdown of civilization in Western Europe - a severe decline in cultural values and standards; a rapid descent into chaos and near-barbarism. So it was a pretty good time for guys. <br />	-- Dave Barry
The Renaissance saw the rebirth of interest in philosophy, science, and the arts, and above all the rise of humanism - a philosophy centered on the distinctive needs, interests and ideals of... not deities, but PEOPLE. Guys were in favor of this because it resulted in statues of naked women. <br />	-- Dave Barry
To understand guys, it is essential to remember that, deep down inside, they are biological creatures, like jellyfish or trees, only less likely to clean the bathroom. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I'm not saying that women don't think about sex also. I'm saying that women are capable, for at least brief periods of time, of NOT thinking about sex, and that most guys are not. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I want to stress here that I am NOT saying that guys are stupid. I am saying that, because of subtle and extremely complex biochmical reactions taking place in their bodies, guys ACT stupid. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Your basic guy dog firmly believes that if he pees on enough territory, he will be declared Dominant Male Dog of the Entire Earth. This is basically the same instince that determines the U.S. foreign policy, except that instead of peeing on foreign countries, we give them money or drop bombs on them, sometimes simultaneously. <br />	-- Dave Barry
We see that testosterone can lead to some very destructive forms of male behavior, the two worst being: (1) War (2) Do-it-yourself projects. <br />	-- Dave Barry
It's hard to avoid falling into the stereotype-toy trap. When my son, Rob, was born, my philosophy was that he should have only politically correct, environmentally sound, gender-neutral toys, such as a spinning top carved out of nonendangered wood or recycled tofu. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Toys marketed for boys tend to encourage the boys' already aggressive nature, which could be why boys spend so much time acting like what trained professional psychologists call "jerks."  Or it could be that boys are born with some kind of jerk gene, and the toy people are merely cashing in on this. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Contrary to what many women believe, it's fairly easy to develop a long-term, stable, intimate, and mutually fulfilling relationship with a guy. Of course, this guy has to be a Labrador retriever. With human guys, it's extremely difficult. <br />	-- Dave Barry
A lot of women have concluded that the problem is that guys, as a group, have the emotional maturity of a hamster. No, this is not the case. A hamster is much more capable of making a lasting commitment to a woman, especially if she gives it those little food pellets. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys are born with a fundamental, genetically transmitted mental condition known to psychologists as: The Fear That If You Get Attatched to a Woman, Some Unattached Guy, Somewhere, Will Be Having More Fun Than You. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys are extremely reluctant to make commitments, or even to take steps that might LEAD to commitments. That is why, when a guy goes out on a date with a woman and finds himself really liking her, he will often demonstrate his affection by avoiding her for the rest of his life. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Consider the behaviour of guy dogs, who spend their lives in a ceaseless quest to establish their masculine dominance by peeing on everything in the entire world. Scientists believe that the reason dogs howl at the moon is because they (the dogs) (also some of the scientists) are upset that the can't get up there and pee on it. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guys care about sport teams. I'm not talking about simply roting; I'm talking about a RELATIONSHIP that guys develop, a COMMITMENT to a sports team that guys take way more seriously than, say, wedding vows. <br />	-- Dave Barry
You may feel that there is something twisted about the values of a guy who can be more committed to a bunch of transient athletes than he is to his own wife. But you have to consider the larger picture, from the guy's point of view: His wife may be a warm, loving, and loyal person, but THERE IS NO WAY SHE WILL EVER MAKE THE PLAY-OFFS. <br />	-- Dave Barry
You should understand that, as a longtime 76ers fan, I hated the Celtics. Not in the way I hate, for example, Hitler, but more often. <br />	-- Dave Barry
I read an article once stating that down in Central America, they take sports a little too seriously in the sense that they routinely kill each other over soccer. (For the record, I think this is over reacting, unless of course once again we are talking about the play-offs.)  <br />	-- Dave Barry
The guy mind doesn't believe in medical care. Guys will generally not seek medical treatment, for themselves or for others, except in clear-cut situations, such as decapitation. And even then, guys are not going to be 100 percent certain. "Let's put his head back on with duct tape and see if he can play a few more innings," is the prevailing guy attitude. <br />	-- Dave Barry
My feeling is that if more guys would join mellow, purposeless, and semi-dysfunctional organizations such as the Lawn Rangers, then there would be a lot fewer guys getting involved in aggressive, venal, destructive, and frequently criminal organizations such as the U.S. Congress. <br />	-- Dave Barry
Guy Memory Lapses stem from the fact that guys devote so much of their brain to remembering vital facts such as who was named MVP of the 1978 Super Bowl that they cannot always remember minor details, such as that they have left an infant on the roof of the car. <br />	-- Dave Barry

When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others. <br />	-- Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970)
When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others. It is much more nearly certain that we are assembled here tonight than it is that this or that political party is in the right.

To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead. <br />	-- Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970)

The world always makes the assumption that the exposure of an error is identical with the discovery of truth--that the error and truth are simply opposite. They are nothing of the sort.

He is trying to perform ordinary tasks, such as lumbering up a hill with a load of fertilizer, when suddenly an icon flashes to tell him that rust has been detected on the starboard cotter pin. <br />	-- Gene Weingarten

Is that really the future? Remember, we thought it would be flying cars, now it's an outhouse you can plug in. <br />	-- Jay Leno
Too many "innovators", especially in the U.S., are resting on their laurels collecting government monopoly profits. At least Microsoft got their monopolies with good old-fashioned misleading marketing, channel strong-arm tactics, and predatory pricing. They worked for it!  <br />	-- Geoff Parker

Windows supports general-purpose non-Microsoft applications in the same way that a rope can be said to support someone who will be soon hanged. <br />	-- Jeff Holtzman UNIX/LINUX Quotes
A big reason that UNIX administration is challenging is that every UNIX vendor believes standards are for weak-minded fools. <br />	-- Ray
A UNIX signature isn't a return address, it's the ASCII equivalent of a black velvet clown painting. It's a rectangle of carets surrounding a quote from a literary giant of weeniedom like Heinlein or Dr. Who.

Let's face facts: J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" books are responsible for more loser circle jerks than Playboy, "Baywatch" and Linux combined.

Unix? You can get a less powerful system, but it will cost you more.
Making files is easy under the UNIX operating system. Therefore, users tend to create numerous files using large amounts of file space. It has been said that the only standard thing about all UNIX systems is the message-of-the-day telling users to clean up their files. <br />	-- System V.2 administrator's guide
Sigh. I like to think it's just the Linux people who want to be on the "leading edge" so bad they walk right off the precipice. <br />	-- Craig E. Groeschel

T: One big monster, he called TROLL. He don't rock, and he don't roll; Drink no wine, and smoke no stogies. He just Love To Eat Them Roguies. <br />	--The Roguelet's ABC
There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are intensely, obsessively, driven to have sex...and those who are not. We are all children of the first kind.
Oh, my baby, when you're cryin' Never hide your face from me I have conquered hell and driven out the demons I have come with the light to set you free  <br />	--Mindy Smith

If you think C++ is not overly complicated, just what is a protected abstract virtual base pure virtual private destructor, and when was the last time you needed one?  <br />	--Peter van der Linded
The fossil record - the La Brea Tar Pit - of software technology is the Internet. Anything that shows up there is free for the taking (possibly illegal, but free). <br />	--Neal Stephenson

At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think of Perl. But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort I mean. Real ugliness is not harsh-looking syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong concepts. <br />	--Paul Graham
Since, therefore, the substance of the mind has been found to be extraordinarily mobile, it must consist of particles exceptionally small and smooth and round. This discovery, my dear fellow, will prove a timely aid to you in many problems. <br />	--Lucretius

Bill Clinton delivered eight years of peace and prosperity, and a highly entertaining sex scandal besides. It wasn't enough. Americans were anxious; worse, they were bored. George Bush delivered four years of war and poverty, and we reelected him. God help us all.

The very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common. Instead of altering their views to fit the facts, they alter the facts to fit their views ... which can be very uncomfortable if you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering. <br />	--Doctor Who, "Face of Evil"
On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?"  I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question. <br />	--Charles Babbage
A plain bar of iron is worth $5, but made into horse shoes it is worth $25; made into kitchen cutlery it is worth $250; made into needles it is worth $3,500; and made into balance springs for watches, it is worth $250,000. The finer the workmanship, the greater the value.
Image data should be written in top-to-bottom scanline order. The JPEG spec contains some weasel wording about how top and bottom are application-defined terms, but if you want your files to be compatible with everyone else's, you WILL use top-to-bottom order. <br />	--from the IJG JPEG library documentation
The badness scale (how bad you want it) 0. No way!  1. I don't really want it, I just like to think about it. 2. Be careful what you wish for... 3. Only a little 4. Some 5. A lot 6. A whole lot 7. Really, really, really! 8. I'm burning with desire. 9. It's an incessant, gnawing hunger.
Now, suppose an election held using your [direct recording electronic voting] machine indicates 15,000 Republicrat votes and 0 (that's zero, as in none at all) for the Democrans. That's a possible, but unlikely outcome. How will you demonstrate that your machine correctly counted each voter's choice?  <br />	--Ed Nisley, 2001 April
Say introduces a report of what someone said; like introduces a performance of it - a question of showing rather than telling. It's a convenient distinction to have in colloquial speech. The only question is why English should suddenly feel the need of the device, after a thousand years of making do without it. <br />	--Geoffrey Nunberg
It's more or less immaterial whether your Artist creates because of a liking for Deluxe Designer Universes or merely because of a liking for caffeine. The simple fact is, we have Artists, and they do Art. We just have to deal with it. We really do. You can make life miserable for the Artist, but the Artist has ways of getting revenge. <br />	--Larry Wall
Programming is costly and unpredictable compared to many other activities, and the resulting code is often less than 100% reliable. Programming is labor-intensive and - for a variety of reasons - most serious project delays manifest themselves by code not being ready to ship. So, why not eliminate programming as an activity altogether?  <br />	--Bjarne Stroustrup
The conception of the objective reality of the elementary particles has thus evaporated in a curious way, not into the fog of some new, obscure, or not yet understood reality concept, but into the transparent clarity of a mathematics that represents no longer the behavior of the elementary particles but rather our knowledge of this behavior. <br />	--Werner Heisenberg
I have long argued that the entertainment industry doesn't want people to have computers. Computers give users too much capability, too much flexibility, too much freedom. The entertainment industry wants users to sit back and consume things. They are trying to turn a computer into an Internet Entertainment Platform, along the lines of a television or VCR. <br />	--Bruce Schneier
Assassination is the extreme form of censorship. <br />	-- George Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950)

Never try to teach a pig to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig.
When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her.
Any sufficiently advanced read/write technology will get used for two purposes: pornography and activism. Porn is a weak test for the success of participatory media - it's like tapping a mike and asking, "Is it on?" If you're not getting porn in your system, it doesn't work. Activism is a stronger test - if activists are using your tools, it's a pretty good indication that your tools are useful and usable. <br />	-- Ethan Zuckerman
The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be. <br />	-- Douglas Adams

He sees Newton immediately and exclaims "Newton! I found you! You're it!" Newton smiles and says "You didn't find me, you found a Newton over a square meter. You found Pascal!"
